# VALIDATION STATUS — per GENESIS charter III.7

This file records the HONEST verification tier of each part of the tool, using
the three tiers from charter III.7. It exists because a sandbox "PASS" is Claude
grading Claude (internal consistency), NOT external truth. Read this before
trusting any "it works" claim.

## The three tiers (III.7)
- **`[self-tested]`** — ran and passed a test Claude also wrote in-sandbox.
  WEAKEST: a wrong mental model produces wrong code AND a wrong test that still
  passes. "Runs and passes my own test" — never call this "verified."
- **`[standard-checked]`** — output validated against a published reference
  artifact Claude FETCHED (real spec/schema pulled via web_fetch), not memory.
  Strongest tier reachable in-session. Authority is external; harness is Claude's.
- **`[externally-verified]`** — confirmed by a non-Claude engine/judge against
  non-Claude input. NOT reachable in-sandbox. A desktop step you or a trusted
  third party runs. Command given per artifact below.

## Tier map (as of v6.0, 2026-07-08)

| Component | Tier reached | How | To reach `[externally-verified]` |
|---|---|---|---|
| SARIF output conforms to spec (scan mode `--sarif`) | `[standard-checked]` | Validated against the FETCHED official OASIS `sarif-schema-2.1.0.json` (543 constraint-checks, 0 violations on the FieldLab output) | Run `jsonschema` (full engine) against the schema; or POST to NIST SARD validator (commands below) |
| SARIF output conforms to spec (ingest mode `--ingest --sarif`) | `[standard-checked]` | Validated against fetched OASIS schema (46 checks, 0 violations) | Same as above |
| Dedup collapses same finding across tools | `[self-tested]` | Passed a 2-tool scenario Claude built (4 raw → 3 unique) | Run on REAL scanner output (e.g. semgrep + codeql on the same repo) and confirm true duplicates collapse |
| Re-ranking puts review-worthy findings first | `[self-tested]` | Passed on Claude-built synthetic findings; the RANKING SIGNALS are `[fetched]`-grounded in the literature, but the ranking being CORRECT on real data is not externally confirmed | Run against a labeled benchmark (Juliet-derived alert set) and measure true-positives-in-top-N |
| Order-independence of ranking | `[self-tested]` | Passed Claude's swap test (identical ranking regardless of input order) | Confirm on real multi-tool output |
| Determinism (byte-identical reruns) | `[self-tested]` | Passed in-sandbox | Confirm on desktop |
| Ranking SIGNAL CHOICE (location/consensus/severity/kind) | `[fetched]` (design) | Grounded in FAULTBENCH/CASTLE/ensemble labeled-benchmark studies | N/A — this is design validation, already external |
| Architecture (deterministic core + governed LLM layer) | `[fetched]` (design) | 2026 production-arch consensus + DUCTILE + SIGPLAN interleaving paper | N/A |
| LLM triage layer behaves per protocol | `[self-tested]` at best | The protocol is `[fetched]`-grounded (CoT/E&V/ZeroFalse); actual per-run behavior is non-deterministic (COBOL-study) and unaudited | Human review of real triage runs; not fully closable |

## The exact desktop commands to reach `[externally-verified]`

**1. Full JSON-schema validation (mechanical, whole schema):**
```
pip install jsonschema
# save the official schema: https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/schemas/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json
python -c "import json,jsonschema; jsonschema.validate(json.load(open('out.sarif')), json.load(open('sarif-schema-2.1.0.json')))"
```
(This runs the COMPLETE schema engine, including $ref resolution — stronger than
the in-bundle `validation/schema_check.py`, which enforces the constraints Claude
transcribed from the fetched schema, not the whole engine.)

**2. NIST SARD validator (independent authority):**
```
curl -sSf -XPOST 'https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/sarif-validator' -F 'file=@out.sarif'
```

**3. Real render (the "use" confirmation):**
Open `out.sarif` in the VS Code SARIF Viewer extension, or upload to a GitHub
repo's Security tab, and confirm findings render.

**4. Dedup/ranking on real data:**
Run two real scanners (e.g. `semgrep --sarif`, CodeQL) on the same repo, then
`audit.py --ingest a.sarif b.sarif` and confirm duplicates collapse and the top
of the list is genuinely what you'd read first.

## Honest bottom line
Format conformance is `[standard-checked]` — genuinely validated against the real
OASIS schema, pulled into the sandbox. The dedup and ranking LOGIC is only
`[self-tested]` — it runs and passes Claude's own tests, but no non-Claude judge
has confirmed it's correct on real data. Closing that gap is a desktop step, by
design (III.5/III.7): Claude cannot be the external judge of its own logic.

## Search & source discipline (charter III.8, ratified 2026-07-08)
Every web-search-grounded claim in this project is tagged `[snippet]` (search
excerpt only) or `[fetched]` (primary source pulled and read). Source selection
follows SIFT (Hapgood 2019) over CRAAP (Blakeslee 2004): prefer
primary/standards-body/.gov/.edu/peer-reviewed; find better coverage before
concluding; report the denominator (results seen vs. read). Genuinely `[fetched]`
in this project: the OASIS SARIF schema; the CRAAP/SIFT frameworks; the secret-
detection tool literature. The rest were `[snippet]`-level and are marked so.

## Known gap: secret scanner has no entropy scoring
Our secret detection is regex-only. Mature tools (Gitleaks, TruffleHog) pair
regex with Shannon entropy (typically 3.5–4.0 bits/char) to cut false positives
— e.g. `password123` (~3.2) passes, a high-entropy token is flagged. We do not
compute entropy, so our false-positive rate on realistic strings is higher than
a mature tool's. `[corroborated]` across independent 2026 sources. This is a
stated design limit, not a defect; documented here so it is never overstated.

## Real-ground-truth validation attempt (2026-07-08): walls, pivots, and honest findings

We tried to move ranking correctness from `[self-tested]` to real external
validation. This section records what actually happened — including the walls —
because the walls are as informative as the wins (charter II.3).

### What we tested against
OWASP Benchmark v1.2: 2,740 human-labeled Java test cases (1,415 real vulns,
1,325 planted false positives), plus real findings from two tools (SonarQube,
FindBugs) — all downloaded by the inventor and joined to the OWASP answer key.
Genuine external ground truth, not Claude-generated. `[fetched]`.

### Finding 1 — our severity/category ranking FAILED its first real test.
Ranking pooled findings globally by category-severity and measured
true-positives-in-top-N. Result: WORSE than random on SonarQube (16 TPs in top-25
vs. ~20 random), no better than random on FindBugs. Honest negative result.

### Pivot — why: the benchmark is documented as hostile to category ranking.
Web search (`[fetched]`, multiple peer-reviewed sources) established OWASP
Benchmark is engineered so category is an unreliable signal — it plants plausible
fakes in the scary categories specifically to defeat "shortcut learning" (OpenAnt
2026; systematic SAST review 2025). Its own scoring AVERAGES per-category on
purpose; global pooling (what we did) is documented as misleading. So the negative
result is CONFOUNDED, not clean — but it does NOT exonerate us: dodging a flawed
test is not a passing test.

### Finding 2 — within-category analysis (category confound neutralized) found REAL signal.
Holding category constant: tool-flagging correlates strongly with truth (74% TP
when a tool flags vs. 38% when none do). A tool's flag is a PERFECT discriminator
in some categories (crypto, hash: 100% TPR / 0% FPR) and pure NOISE in others
(cmdi, ldapi: flags everything). This is real signal on real ground truth, though
still on synthetic data with documented transfer caveats.

### Finding 3 — the data points at a signal we DON'T currently compute.
The right ranking signal is not "category severity" but "how discriminating is
THIS tool in THIS context" — per-tool-per-rule reliability. This matches the
FAULTBENCH literature (location + history of past alerts = top predictors). Our
tool doesn't compute it yet. Honest gap → concrete design direction.

### Wall 1 — consensus signal untestable on this data.
SonarQube and FindBugs flagged the SAME case ZERO times (CWE-normalization
artifact of the scorecards). Our headline signal — diversity-aware consensus —
had nothing to fire on. Cannot be validated here. Needs a genuinely overlapping
tool pair, or raw SARIF from two tools on the same code.

### Wall 2 — PrimeVul (the right instrument) could not be fetched.
The realistic corrective (PrimeVul: ~7k real vulnerable + ~229k benign functions,
WITH file-path metadata our location signal needs) was identified and confirmed
real. But the data files are HuggingFace-hosted and too large / access-gated to
pull into the sandbox, and too large to reasonably hand-download. Location signal
therefore REMAINS UNTESTED. Named honestly as an open item, not closed.

### Design outcome — evidence-driven signal gating (NOT benchmark detection).
The inventor asked: can the tool selectively use only the signals that fit the
input? Yes — but the selection criterion is "does this input contain the evidence
each signal needs?" NEVER "is this a known benchmark?" (the latter is
benchmark-gaming, the exact trap the research warns against). Implemented as a
gate that, per input, reports which signals are informative (location variety?
tool overlap? severity spread?) and DOWN-WEIGHTS + DISCLOSES the ones that aren't.
On OWASP-shaped input it correctly reports "all three ranking signals
uninformative here; ranking low-confidence." This degrades nothing, works on any
input, and makes the tool self-disclosing about its own competence — which is the
charter ethos, not a benchmark hack.

### Honest tier summary after this session
- Consensus/tool-flag correlates with truth: `[standard-checked]` (real ground
  truth, synthetic-data caveat). Real signal, confirmed.
- Severity/category ranking alone: `[standard-checked]` and FOUND WANTING; the
  better signal (per-tool-per-context reliability) is not yet built.
- Location signal: still `[self-tested]` — the instrument to test it (PrimeVul)
  exists but could not be reached in-session.
- Evidence-driven signal gate: `[self-tested]` (new; runs and behaves correctly
  on shaped inputs, but "correct on real data" needs the same external tests).

## Systematic design-claim audit (2026-07-08): every load-bearing claim, re-tagged

The inventor asked to apply multi-framing external search across ALL prior
deliverables, and to close coverage gaps. HONEST SCOPE NOTE FIRST: gaps that
require a non-Claude judge on real data CANNOT be closed in-session (charter
III.7) — searching can move a claim's DESIGN from `[self-tested]` to
`[corroborated]`/`[fetched]` by grounding the principle in literature, but it
CANNOT make our specific implementation's CORRECTNESS externally verified. So
this audit closes the *grounding* gaps it can and names the rest as un-closable
here. Distinguishing "design grounded" from "implementation verified" is the
whole point.

| Claim | Design tier (after audit) | Implementation tier | External grounding found |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deterministic backbone + governed LLM layer | `[fetched]` | n/a (architecture) | 2026 production-arch consensus; DUCTILE; SIGPLAN interleaving; tool-calibration "confidence dichotomy" paper independently endorses deterministic-floor design |
| SARIF format conformance | `[standard-checked]` | `[standard-checked]` | validated vs. fetched OASIS schema (543/46 checks, 0 violations) |
| Ranking signal CHOICE (location/consensus/severity/kind) | `[fetched]` | — | FAULTBENCH/CASTLE/ensemble labeled-benchmark literature |
| Diversity-aware consensus (distinct tools only) | `[fetched]` | `[self-tested]` | CASTLE: redundant-tool overlap amplifies shared FPs |
| Dedup by fingerprint/location | `[corroborated]` | `[self-tested]` | DefectDojo mechanism; Wiz/AI-SAST dedup-then-rank is standard ASPM |
| Subprocess/E2E coverage-confidence flag | `[corroborated]` | `[self-tested]` | coverage.py + multiple 2025/26 sources: subprocess-spawned tests are a DOCUMENTED coverage blind spot |
| Monorepo/polyglot detection (colocation≠monorepo, substance-weighting) | `[corroborated]` | `[self-tested]` | monorepo.tools, Nx, + peer-reviewed Multivocal Literature Review on monorepo definitions |
| Inline-test detection (Rust cfg(test)/Go Example/py doctest) | `[self-tested]` | `[self-tested]` | language docs confirm the CONSTRUCTS exist; our detection accuracy unverified |
| Secret regex design limits (regex-only, no entropy) | `[corroborated]` | `[self-tested]` | Gitleaks/TruffleHog literature: regex+entropy is the mature standard; we lack entropy — STATED GAP |
| LLM triage protocol (CoT, verify-first, cite-or-abstain) | `[fetched]` | `[self-tested]` | ZeroFalse/E&V/IEEE CoT study |
| Evidence-driven signal gate | `[corroborated]` | `[self-tested]` | FIVE literatures: selective prediction, confidence-gating theorem, adaptive alert ranking (Heckman 2007), mutual-information/permutation testing, OOD/out-of-model-scope detection; "bouncers" paper is near-identical concept |

### Gaps that remain OPEN (un-closable in-session, by design — III.7)
Every "Implementation `[self-tested]`" above needs the same thing to close: a
non-Claude judge (real scanner output, labeled benchmark, or execution engine)
on non-Claude input. The instruments exist (Juliet/OWASP/PrimeVul) but could not
be run in-sandbox. These are honest desktop steps, listed with commands earlier
in this file. NONE are closed by this audit; all are now precisely NAMED.

### The load-bearing open gap (flagged loudly)
The evidence-driven signal gate's confidence signal is ITSELF unverified — we
never ran the "competent for gating" test (does our confidence label actually
predict ranking quality? — Spearman ρ > 0, per the robot-autonomy paper). This
is an unverified assumption inside the mechanism we built to police unverified
assumptions. Highest-priority thing to verify on real data. Not closed here.

### What the multi-framing audit DID accomplish
Moved 4 claims from `[self-tested]` design → `[corroborated]`/`[fetched]` design
(dedup, subprocess-confidence, monorepo, signal-gate) by grounding their
PRINCIPLES in external literature. Confirmed nothing we designed is idiosyncratic
— every major choice has independent literature support. But design-grounding is
not implementation-verification, and this audit changed zero implementation tiers.

## Full 5-framing literature sweep (2026-07-08): every load-bearing claim, all framings

The inventor requested the complete sweep: every load-bearing design claim audited
through 5 distinct search framings — (1) SAST/security-tooling, (2) ML/statistics,
(3) formal/theory, (4) software-engineering practice, (5) adjacent field — with
empties reported honestly as negative results. This is the exhaustive version;
future audits will target load-bearing claims only.

HONEST SCOPE CORRECTION: the working inventory initially listed 12 claims, but
"coverage-confidence (E2E)" and "subprocess/coverage-confidence" are the SAME
claim (the flag IS the mechanism). Real count: 11 distinct claims × 5 framings =
55 framing-cells. All 55 filled.

### Per-claim results (design-grounding tier after full sweep)

1. **Architecture (deterministic backbone + governed LLM)** — `[fetched]`, all 5.
   Strongest-validated decision in the tool. Formal: neuro-symbolic separation
   (deterministic engine + non-authoritative LLM explainer = 100% determinism).
   Adjacent: the MANDATED safety-critical pattern (defense guidance, aviation
   autopilot advisory-only, clinical CDSS logic-vs-governance split). "Deterministic
   shell, probabilistic core" is a named standard pattern.

2. **SARIF format conformance** — `[standard-checked]`, all 5. Validated vs the real
   OASIS schema. Both new framings SHARPEN the boundary: schema-conformance ≠
   content-correctness (ML) and = "conformance testing" not "certification" or
   "verification" (adjacent). Matches charter "tools verify presence not truth."

3. **Ranking-signal choice** — `[fetched]`, all 5. Formal: Learning-to-Rank frames
   it as feature-vector scoring; optimal combination is NP-hard (so fixed weights
   defensible). Adjacent: medical triage (ESI) uses identical weighted-signal
   ranking AND independently confirms our OWASP lesson (signals weak in isolation,
   over/under-triage common, context-dependent).

4. **Diversity-aware consensus** — `[fetched]`, all 5, EMPIRICALLY validated.
   Formal: correlated errors provide no ensemble benefit (proof); reducing
   correlation tightens error bound. SE-practice: NPM study — tool intersection
   → 97% precision, cross-methodology pairs win (disjoint miss-sets). Adjacent:
   inter-rater reliability ("reliable raters behave like independent witnesses").

5. **Dedup** — `[fetched]`, all 5. GAP surfaced + confirmed across 3 independent
   fields (SAST, record-linkage, storage): exact-fingerprint is high-precision/
   low-recall, brittle to code-shift; mature fix = scope/content-based hashing.
   Formal: set-union is commutative/associative/idempotent (proves order-independence).

6. **Coverage-confidence / subprocess detection** — `[fetched]`, all 5. Formal:
   exact coverage is UNDECIDABLE (Rice) — our humility is FORCED, not optional.
   ML: missing-mass/unseen-species gives a principled lower-bound upgrade path.
   Adjacent: professional audit "sampling risk" + "scope-limitation disclaimer."

7. **Monorepo/polyglot detection** — `[corroborated]`, all 5. Formal VINDICATES
   the heuristic: proper graph-partition detection is NP-hard + resolution-limited,
   so a lightweight heuristic is defensible (as Nx/Bazel also do). ML exposes it's
   a coarse proxy for community-detection. Adjacent (ecology) weak/analogical, noted.

8. **Inline-test detection** — `[corroborated]`, 4 of 5 (1 HONEST EMPTY). SE-practice
   strongest: #[cfg(test)]/doctests are documented conventions. Formal partial
   (conditional-compilation/DCE). Adjacent field: NO grounding found — "test-as-
   scaffolding" is metaphor only. Negative result reported, not forced.

9. **Secret regex limits (no entropy)** — `[fetched]`, all 5. Exemplary honest
   self-assessment: our disclosed "regex-only" gap is accurate and corroborated
   across 5 fields; formal (Kolmogorov: K uncomputable, random/structured
   distinction is crypto-hard) shows even the FIX (entropy) has a theoretical ceiling.

10. **LLM triage protocol** — `[fetched]`, all 5. Formal both-edged: stepwise
    soundness frameworks support verify-first, BUT faithfulness tests measure
    output self-consistency not true reasoning (validates charter's "Claude can't
    judge own logic"). Adjacent: clinical debiasing (checklists, second opinion,
    consider-opposite) = our protocol; mitigates not guarantees.

11. **Evidence-driven signal gate** — `[corroborated]`, all 5 (earlier this session).
    Selective prediction / confidence-gating / adaptive alert ranking / mutual-
    information / OOD detection. LOAD-BEARING GAP: our confidence signal is itself
    unverified (the "competent for gating" Spearman-ρ test — desktop-only).

### What the full sweep established
- Every one of the 11 load-bearing design claims is grounded across multiple
  independent literatures. NOTHING we designed is idiosyncratic — every major
  choice was independently arrived at by one or more established fields.
- 1 honest empty (inline-test / adjacent) and several weak/partial hits, all
  flagged rather than inflated.
- Recurring honest pattern: our GOALS/DESIGNS are well-grounded; our METHODS are
  frequently the lightweight-heuristic version of a rigorous (often NP-hard or
  uncomputable) ideal — which the theory itself shows is a defensible tradeoff.
- CRUCIAL: this sweep changed only DESIGN-grounding tiers. Zero IMPLEMENTATION
  tiers moved. Design-grounding ≠ implementation-verification (charter III.7).
  Every implementation claim remains `[self-tested]`, closable only by an external
  judge on real data (desktop). The sweep tells us we're building the right things;
  it does NOT tell us we built them correctly.

## External validation on real CVE data (2026-07-09): diversity-consensus principle

This is the first validation in this project's history against **real external
ground truth** (not literature, not sandbox self-test). It closes a chain that
started with the OWASP negative result and ran through the tool-overlap wall.

### Data & provenance
- Source: Lipp, Banescu, Pretschner, "An Empirical Study on the Effectiveness of
  Static C Code Analyzers for Vulnerability Detection," ISSTA'22.
  Artifact: Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6515687 (CC-BY-4.0). Fetched via Zenodo
  (record metadata web-fetchable; data files hand-downloaded by inventor and
  re-uploaded — the confirmed workaround for robots-gated file payloads).
- Content: 6 distinct SAST tools (Flawfinder, Cppcheck, Infer, CodeChecker,
  CodeQL, CommSCA) run on 27 real C projects, 1.15M LoC, 192/193 validated CVEs
  as ground truth. Per-finding tool flags (file, line, CWE, found_by) in
  sca_results.json — the tool-OVERLAP data OWASP structurally could not provide.

### Methodology (faithful to the source paper, NOT improvised)
- Unit = FUNCTION (the paper's validated granularity choice; Section 3.2, FEC
  metric). NOT per-finding — an earlier per-finding oracle was abandoned as
  methodologically invalid (it produced a meaningless 1.2% TP rate because no
  per-finding precision ground truth exists — see "honest limits" below).
- Detection (Scenario S1-1): a CVE is detected if >=1 of its affected functions
  is marked by >=1 tool in the set, regardless of vuln class.
- FP proxy = Marked-Function Ratio (the paper's own precision surrogate, since
  per-finding precision ground truth does not exist).

### Reconstruction cross-check (why this result is trustworthy)
Our independently-built oracle reproduces the paper's published figures:
- CommSCA best single tool @ 53.9% (paper: ~53%, "misses 47%"). MATCH.
- All-6-tools recall 68.9% / 133 CVEs (paper: ~70%, 135/192). MATCH.
- Lift +15.0pp detection @ +12pp functions flagged (paper: +17pp @ +15pp). MATCH.
An independently-constructed oracle landing on externally-published numbers is
the check that distinguishes this from a sandbox result grading itself.

### Result: diversity-aware consensus — design principle CONFIRMED on real data
- **Spearman rho (n_distinct_tools vs recall) = +0.700** across all 63 combos.
- Monotonic, no reversals: k=1 22.2% -> k=2 38.2% -> k=3 49.8% -> k=4 58.3%
  -> k=5 64.4% -> k=6 68.9% mean recall.
- Combining all 6 distinct tools: +15pp CVE detection over best single tool.
- Contrast: OWASP gave rho = UNDEFINED (zero tool overlap). Right instrument -> +0.700.
- This is the exact mechanism our signal gate's diversity-aware consensus encodes
  (distinct tools have disjoint miss-sets; union across DISTINCT tools recovers
  misses). Tier for the PRINCIPLE moves to [externally-grounded].

### Honest limits (what this does NOT establish)
- Implementation NOT validated. This confirms the PRINCIPLE our gate relies on is
  true on real data; it does not verify audit.py computes consensus correctly.
  Implementation tier remains [self-tested], unchanged.
- Recall-side only. Measures detection + flagged-function FP proxy, NOT per-finding
  precision. Per the source paper's own statement, per-finding precision ground
  truth DOES NOT EXIST in this (or comparable public) datasets.
- Therefore the per-finding competence-rho of our confidence signal is
  **untestable with existing public ground truth** — reclassified from
  "untested, need data" to "requires either self-run tools with manual
  per-finding labeling, or acceptance of recall-level validation as the closest
  available." This is a ground-truth-EXISTENCE limit, not an access limit.

### Two refinements surfaced BY the data (specified, not vague)
1. **Cost-weighting the consensus signal.** Diversity buys +15pp detection at
   +12pp more functions flagged — not free. UPGRADE: the gate should expose the
   recall/flagged-ratio tradeoff (detection gained per additional function
   flagged) rather than treating "more tools agreeing" as costless. Concretely:
   report marginal-detection-per-marginal-flag when adding a tool to the set.
2. **Tool-quality weighting ("good vs bad diversity").** CommSCA alone (54%)
   beats many 3-tool open-source combos; a weak tool's agreement is worth less
   than a strong tool's. UPGRADE: weight each tool's consensus contribution by
   its standalone reliability (per-tool, ideally per-CWE-class recall), instead
   of treating tools interchangeably. Matches the ensemble-theory "good diversity
   vs bad diversity" decomposition already in the framing sweep (claim 4, F3).

## Real multi-tool ingest test + implementation fixes (2026-07-09, cont.)

After the recall-side principle validation (rho=+0.700), we ran the IMPLEMENTATION
against real multi-tool output — the test the synthetic-Juliet live-scanner run
could not provide (cppcheck found nothing on Juliet; studied + reframed: Juliet is
synthetic macro-guarded code that the source paper itself warns is non-
representative, so forcing a result there would validate nothing).

### Test: audit.py --ingest on real Lipp findings (PHP subject, richest overlap)
- Converted the real PHP sca_results.json (22,403 real findings from 6 distinct
  tools, with 1,318 genuine cross-tool overlaps) into per-tool SARIF and ran
  audit.py --ingest on all six.
- PROVENANCE NOTE: the findings (file, line, CWE, which-tools) are 100% real Lipp
  data; the SARIF *envelope* was reconstructed (Lipp is not distributed as SARIF).
  So this validates processing of real multi-tool FINDINGS with real overlap; the
  raw live-scanner-SARIF parse path is covered separately by the flawfinder run.

### Results — implementation behaves correctly on real overlap
- Dedup: 22,403 raw -> 21,061 unique. Independently MATCHES the hand-computed PHP
  distinct-finding count. Dedup arithmetic conforms to ground truth.
- Overlap recovery: tool surfaced exactly 1,318 multi-tool findings — IDENTICAL to
  the hand-computed overlap count. Not approximate; exact.
- Signal gate: correctly detected consensus as informative and raised ranking
  confidence to "high" when real overlap was present (vs "medium"/severity-only on
  the single-tool Juliet run). This consensus-active path had never been exercised
  on real input before.
- Ranking reproduces the validated principle: mean review-worthiness score rises
  monotonically with tool agreement (1 tool 5.21 -> 2 tools 6.70 -> 3 tools 8.30);
  Spearman(n_tools, our-score)=+0.649, consistent with the hand-validated recall-
  side rho=+0.700. The implementation encodes the externally-validated principle.
- Top findings are all 3-distinct-tool agreements (e.g. CWE-476 null-deref in
  phar_object.c flagged by CodeChecker+CodeQL+Cppcheck) — diversity-consensus
  mechanism working on real code.

### Tier movement
Ingest/dedup/consensus-ranking machinery moves from [self-tested] toward
[externally-grounded]: it (a) processed real external tool findings, (b) matched
an independently-computed overlap count EXACTLY (1,318=1,318), and (c) reproduced
a separately-validated principle. Three external anchors, not self-grading.
HONEST BOUND: real findings + real overlap + real principle-match; SARIF envelope
reconstructed. Live raw-SARIF parse validated separately (flawfinder, below).

### Two real implementation bugs found on real data + FIXED
Surfaced by running on the actual Mac with real scanners — exactly what external
execution exists to find. Both fixed and regression-tested (real 6-tool ingest
output verified byte-stable after fixes):
1. No --help handler: `audit.py --help` treated "--help" as a directory path
   ("not a directory: --help"). FIXED: --help/-h now prints usage, exits 0.
2. Empty SARIF raised an alarming parse error. A scanner that finds nothing may
   emit an empty file — not a malformed input. FIXED: empty/whitespace-only inputs
   report as clean "empty (no findings) — skipped"; genuinely malformed input
   STILL reports a real parse error (verified — the fix distinguishes the two,
   does not swallow real errors). Graceful-degradation design confirmed on real
   bad input throughout.

### Third bug (same class) found during fix-verification + root-caused
While regression-testing the --help fix, `audit.py --run-tests` (flag with no
directory) failed with "not a directory: --run-tests" — the SAME bug class as
--help (a flag treated as a path). Rather than patch per-flag, root-caused it:
PROJECT_DIR is now resolved as the first non-flag positional argument (skipping
--json/--sarif values), so modifier flags in any position are never mistaken for
a path, and a flag-only invocation prints usage + a clear error. Verified across
five invocation shapes (flag-only, --help, dir scan, dir+modifier, ingest) with
the real 6-tool ingest output confirmed byte-stable (21,061 dedup / 1,318 overlap
unchanged). Lesson recorded: the first two fixes patched instances; the class
needed a root fix. This is itself evidence for why external execution matters —
the flaw was invisible to prior sandbox self-testing.
